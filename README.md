Products Used:
BOARD & STEMMA-QT PORT
- Raspberry Pi Pico (any pico series, original, 2, any W, will work the same)
- STEMMA-QT / Qwiic Cable with pin jumpers
or
- CircuitPlayground Bluefruit (the CircuitPlayground Express isn't powerful enough for this build - it doesn't support the AudioMixer library)
- STEMMA-QT / Qwiic Cable with Aligator Clip Jumpers

TOUCHPAD SENSOR & CABLES
- MPR121 12 pad gator capacitive touch STEMMA-QT sensor.
- 12 alligator clips to connect the MPR121 pads to touch surfaces (metal, fruit, copper tape, coins)
- Any speaker with a 3.5mm audio jack (I used one like this)

SPEAKER TO BOARD CONNECTION
- CircuitPlayground can use two gator/gator cables.
- Pico can use two gator / pin jumper cables
  OR
- Breadboard
- Breadboard-friendly stereo jack (if you have a stereo pin on your 3.5 mm audio jack. Stereo pins have 3 sections separated by two lines)
- Two pin-pin jumper wires (for pico) or two pin-gator jumper wires for CircuitPlayground
